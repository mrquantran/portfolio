# What I do

I have been shipping code for well over two decades now, and I still really love my work. I am a huge fan of the React framework and have decades worth of experience with the .NET ecosystem which is why I tend to gravitate towards front-end heavy full stack roles. I have entirely embraced TypeScript for anything I would normally have written in JavaScript - such as a React front-end, NodeJS middle tier code, or even personal experiments with React Native. Lately I have been focusing on automating my code quality through the use of good static analysis tools like ESLint and Prettier paired with an extensive test suite - usually leveraging Kent C. Doddâ€™s excellent Testing Library to enhance the Jest testing framework (example).
